    General artificial intelligence refers to machine intelligence than performs a task as successfully as a human does. A fundamental difference between human neural network and current machine neural networks is that only human networks combine symbolic reasoning with computation. Here we show how a graph can \ldots

\section{Background}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is symbolic computation?
        
        A symbolic computation is a calculation performed with symbolic representations of values and operations. A simple example would be the expression $(x + 1)(x - 1)$ which would evaluate to $x^2 - 1$, rather than to some numerical result.

        \item What is calculation?
        
        A calculation is a process by which one or more inputs is transformed into one or more results. One may calculate that the product of 5 and 4 is 20.
        
        \item What is meant by a computational class? \textcolor{red}{- do you mean complexity class?}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Network Construction}

 Figure \ref{fig:sig-neuron} illustrates a neuron that receives three ordered inputs.

    \node[below= 2cm of soma] (dendrite) {};

    \node[below right = of soma] (operator) {operator};
    \node[below = of operator] (operand1) {operand1};
    \node[below = of operand1] (operand2) {operand2};
    \end{scope}
    
    
    \draw[->] (dendrite) -> (soma);
    
    
    %nodes along dendrite
    \node (operator'dendrite) at (intersection of operator--soma|-operator and dendrite--soma){};
    
    \node (operand1'dendrite) at (intersection of operand1--soma|-operand1 and dendrite--soma){};
    
    \node (operand2'dendrite) at (intersection of operand2--soma|-operand2 and dendrite--soma){};
    
    
    \draw[->] (operator) -- (operator'dendrite) node[midway, fill=white] {1};
    \draw[->] (operand1) -- (operand1'dendrite) node[midway, fill=white] {2};
    \draw[->] (operand2) -- (operand2'dendrite) node[midway, fill=white] {3};

While this model is suitable for biological networks of neurons, a neural network in the computational sense would look more like an abstract syntax tree. In the following diagram, a network of operators and operands form a tree-like structure in which elements at lower levels represent values to manipulate which at higher levels interact with each other through arithmetic operations to produce a result. Any computation which involves a combination of operations on one or more values can be represented in this structure, such as logical operations or large-scale machine learning models.
