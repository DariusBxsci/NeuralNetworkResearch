        \item What is symbolic computation?
        
        A symbolic computation is a calculation performed with symbolic representations of values and operations. A simple example would be the expression $(x + 1)(x - 1)$ which would evaluate to $x^2 - 1$, rather than to some numerical result.

        \item What is calculation?
        
        A calculation is a process by which one or more inputs is transformed into one or more results. One may calculate that the product of 5 and 4 is 20.
        
        \item What is meant by a computational class? \textcolor{red}{- do you mean complexity class?}
