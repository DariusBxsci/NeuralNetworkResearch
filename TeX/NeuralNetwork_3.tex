	When constructing Neural Networks, we generally consider the order of inputs to neurons or the order of inputs in a layer, to be irrelivent. However, there is no reason that the order of inputs should be self-evident, and in many cases, the best order of inputs may not be known at all. To examine this, let us create a simple model for a single neuron, where it accepts any number of inputs and has a single output which is the result of applying the 'eval' function to the inputs.

	Each input is a tuple where the first index is either an operator or operand, and the second index contains the input's position in the eval function.
