-- The purpose of this document is to record notes/reflect about each portion of our research and about different ideas regarding the direction of the project --

USEFUL/INTERESTING PAPERS:
	Symbolic reasoning in neural nets: https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS15/paper/viewPDFInterstitial/10281/10029

Addition/Subtraction Network:
	-Input to a network may be represented as a list, then passed into the eval() function


Input Permutation Network:
	-Use a permutation matrix to reformat an expression such as 'a + b + c - d' into one which can be parsed by eval() 
	-Write an algorithm to generalize the matrix for any size of the expression
	-The resulting expression should look something like: '- + + a b c d'

Lollipop model:
	-Several inputs and a single output
	-The inputs are not ordered, but the inputs themselves will be tuples such as
		[2, 1] [+, 0] [3, 2],
		which have an operand or opertator in the first index, and the position of that element in the second
	-Possible extension:
		-implement some sort of simple algorithm to determine the correct position of inputs given some output examples
			-RESEARCH QUESTION: ^^^ Is this possible? ^^^

Abstract Syntax Tree
	-Operators are interchangeable, just as operands are.
	-Can be implemented similarly to binary trees
